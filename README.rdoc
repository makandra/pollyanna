= Pollyanna - very simple search

== Make a model searchable

- Add a text column "search_text" to a model
- Have the model include Pollyanna::Searchable
- Overwrite #search_text to define which text is indexed upon saving
- Get a scope for your match with Model.search("query words here")
- There's some more goodness I don't care to document. Use the code, Luke!
